				<p>Queuing to order food is and has always been a common occurance. Traditionally, these queues follow a First-Come-First-Serve system as it is 'fair' to customers who arrived early to place on order for their meal. This sometimes results in large queue lengths and long queue times if the service rate of the store is unable to match the arrival rate of customers. This can be frustrating for both the customers, who need to deal with the time they spend queuing, as well as the store owners, who are pressured to serve the growing queue.</p> 
				<p>In recent times, there have been an increasing number of shops and stores opting for alternative queueing systems, most notably the split queue system. The first queue follows the traditional FCFS queue, where customers queue to place their order and payment. However, after they done that, they will proceed to wait for their food/items which may not be served in order. </p>
				<p>More description lorem ipsum

				<p>Through this project we hope to find out if this alternative queuing system is indeed effective in reducing wait times or is this a perceived effect on the customers' end.</p>
