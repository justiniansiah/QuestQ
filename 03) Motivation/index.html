				<p>
				Traditionally queues in food and beverage outlets, and queues in Singaporean food courts and 
				hawker centres have followed a First-Come-First-Serve systems, in order to deliver the
				product first to customers who made the order first. This sometimes results in large queue lengths and 
				long queue times if the service rate of the store is unable to match the arrival rate of customers. 
				This can be frustrating for both the customers, who need to deal with the time they spend queuing,
				as well as the store owners, who are pressured to serve the growing queue.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				In recent times, there have been an increasing number of shops and stores opting for 
				alternative queuing systems, most notably the tandem queuing system. The first queue follows the 
				traditional FCFS queue, where customers queue to place their order and payment.
				Afterwards, customers proceed to wait for their food/items in the second queue.
				Orders may not be served in the sequence they were made. This allows shopkeepers to reduce
				production time by preparing similar dishes together as they have more knowledge about
				what the incoming orders are.
				</p>	
				<p>
				The figures below illustrate the differences between FCFS and tandem queuing systems.

				Through this project we hope to find out if this alternative queuing system is indeed effective in reducing wait times or is this a perceived effect on the customers' end.
