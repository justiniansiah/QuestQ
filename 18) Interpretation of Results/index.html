						Before we begin our comparison between the initial queueing systemand the proposed queueing system, it is essential that we ensure our simulated observations of the initial queuing system are statistically similar to what we observe in real life. Non-peak period analysis ensures that we intialise our queueing systems realistically, and peak period analysis ensures that our system behaves correctly during periods we intend on analysing for comparison.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to do this, we begin by comparing the distributions of simulated and observed interarrival times during both peak and non-peak periods. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As seen above, both of our simulated outputs follow a similar trend to the observed interarrivals. However, both peak and non-peak simulations overestimate the smaller interarrival times; this effect is more obvious in the non-peak graph. </p>
					<p>	
						Our model for the non-peak greatly overestimates the number of short interarrivals while slightly underestimating the longer interarrivals. Hence our final results might be affected as the final queue length at the end of the non-peak period might be simulated to be larger than expected.</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, our values for the peak interarrival times faired much better. Although it is still overestimating the shorter arrivals, it is a smaller overestimation. Though it might still result in longer waiting times due to a longer queue being formed.
					</p> 
					<p> 
			  			In order to justify the claim that both simulated distributions are sufficiently statistically close to observed distributions, we perform a paired t-test on simulated and observed arrays of data points, for both peak and non-peak datasets, where the null and the alternative hypothesis respectively are:
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			H<sub>0</sub>: Mean of simulated and observed inter-arrival observations are statistically equivalent, &mu;<sub>0</sub> = &mu;<sub>1</sub>
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			H<sub>&alpha;</sub>: Mean of simulated and observed observations are not statistically equivalent, &mu;<sub>0</sub> ≠ &mu;<sub>1</sub>
			  		</p>

			  		<p>
			  			Subsequently, for peak period interarrival times, we obtained a p value of  0.3202 and T-statistic value of 0.8605, after performing a two-tailed pairwise t-test. At 95% confidence, the T-statistic is greater smaller than the T-critical value 1.96 and the p-value is greater than the &alpha; of 0.05, we can conclude that is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			For non-peak interarrival times, we obtained a p value of  0.321 and T-statistic value of 1.003, after performing a two-tailed pairwise t-test. At 95% confidence, the T-statistic is greater smaller than the T-critical value 2.01 and the p-value is greater than the &alpha; of 0.05, we can conclude that is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
			  		</p>

			  		<p>
			  			In other words, the means of the simulated and observed values of interarrival time time for the first queueing system in both peak and non-peak periods are statistically similar.

			  			After ensuring that inter-arrival time simulations were correct for both peak, and non-peak periods, we begin our analysis on simulated lead time observations during peak periods. In this section, we compare simulated and observed values of lead time for the initial model during peak periods only, and evaluate wether our simulated observations match real-life observations 
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			As can be seen from the figure above, the simulated values matches the observed values quite well, as seen from the shape. However it underpredicts the number of shorter waiting times (0-200s) and overpredicts the number of longer waiting times (400-600).
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			Considering that there may be errors in observation and our sample size is spread over a different days, and could have influenced the observations, the simulated values generated looks to be sufficiently accurate.</p>
			  		<p> 
			  			In order to justify the claim, we perform a paired t-test on simulated and observed arrays of data points where the null and the alternative hypothesis respectively are:
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			H<sub>0</sub>: Mean of simulated and observed peak lead time values are statistically equivalent, &mu;<sub>0</sub> = &mu;<sub>1</sub>
			  		</p>
			  		<p>
			  			H<sub>&alpha;</sub>: Mean of simulated and observed peak lead time values are not statistically equivalent, &mu;<sub>0</sub> ≠ &mu;<sub>1</sub>
			  		</p>

			  		<p>
			  			Subsequently, we obtained a p value of  0.0681 and T-statistic value of 1.8305, after performing a two-tailed pairwise t-test. At 95% confidence, the T-statistic is greater smaller than the T-critical value 1.96 and the p-value is greater than the &alpha; of 0.05, we can conclude that is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

					<p class="pjust">As seen in the table above, the average time the customer spends in waiting increases when there are more people in the queue at the start of the peak period. This is to be expected as a longer starting queue would mean the server is more likely to run at full capacity as the peak crowd comes in.</p>
					<p class="pjust">The graph is mostly linear with the exception of 0. This is also to be expected as the rate of service does not change and a larger initalization queue length would not doubt result in longer queues and by extension, longer waiting times.</p>
					<p class="pjust">Since the values of queue size 0 and 1 looks about the same and there are some runs where in fact an initial queue length of 1 would yield a smaller average waiting time, we decided to do a t-test to confirm if there is any significant effect of having 0 or 1 as the initial queue length.</p>

					<br />

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">T-test for Inital Queue Lengths of 0 and 1</h3>

					<p class="pjust">We simulated 1000 iterations of queue length 0 and 1 with CRN and took the difference between the average waiting time (Q0-Q1). The data is saved in the csv <a href="Queue01Comparison.csv">here</a> the resulting confidence interval with &alpha; = 0.05:</p>
