						As seen above, both of our simulated outputs follow a similar trend to the observed interarrivals. However, both simulations overestimate the smaller interarrival times, this effect is more obvious in the non-peak graph. </p>
					<p>	
						Our model for the non-peak greatly overestimates the number of short interarrivals while slightly underestimating the longer interarrivals. Hence our final results might be affected as the final queue length at the end of the non-peak period might be simulated to be larger than expected.</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, our values for the peak interarrival times faired much better. Although it is still overestimating the shorter arrivals, it is a smaller overestimation. Though it might still result in longer waiting times due to a longer queue being formed.</p>

			  		<p>The simulated values matches the observed values quite well, as seen from the shape. However it underpredicts the number of shorter waiting times (0-200s) and overpredicts the number of longer waiting times (400-600).</p>
			  		<p>Considering that there may be errors in observation and our sample size is spread over a different days, and could have influenced the observations, the simulated values generated looks to be sufficiently accurate.</p>

			  <div class = "divmiddle" style = "margin-top: 1rem; text-align: justify;">
			  	<p>After running the simulation, we plotted a graph of average waiting time against the initialization queue lengths, as shown.</p>

					<p class="pjust">As seen in the table above, the average time the customer spends in waiting increases when there are more people in the queue at the start of the peak period. This is to be expected as a longer starting queue would mean the server is more likely to run at full capacity as the peak crowd comes in.</p>
					<p class="pjust">The graph is mostly linear with the exception of 0. This is also to be expected as the rate of service does not change and a larger initalization queue length would not doubt result in longer queues and by extension, longer waiting times.</p>
					<p class="pjust">Since the values of queue size 0 and 1 looks about the same and there are some runs where in fact an initial queue length of 1 would yield a smaller average waiting time, we decided to do a t-test to confirm if there is any significant effect of having 0 or 1 as the initial queue length.</p>

					<br />

					<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">T-test for Inital Queue Lengths of 0 and 1</h3>

					<p class="pjust">We simulated 1000 iterations of queue length 0 and 1 with CRN and took the difference between the average waiting time (Q0-Q1). The data is saved in the csv <a href="Queue01Comparison.csv">here</a> the resulting confidence interval with &alpha; = 0.05:</p>
					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; ">( -3.570022 , -1.194845 )</p>

					<p class="pjust">Since 0 is not within the confidence interval, we can say with 95% confidence that the true difference will be negative, meaning that <b><u>initializing the queue with 0 will have a shorter average waiting time.</u></b>

			  <div class = "divmiddle" style = "margin-top: 1rem;">
			  	<p>For the comparison of the the traditional vs alternative queue, we obtained the following confidence interval with &alpha; = 0.05:</p>

			  	<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; ">( 239.5266 , 296.6334 )</p>

			  	<p class="pjust">Since 0 is not within the confidence interval, we can say with 95% confidence that the true difference will be positive, meaning that <b><u>the alternative system is perferred as the original system has a higher average waiting time.</u></b>
