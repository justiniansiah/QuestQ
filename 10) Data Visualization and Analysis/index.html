			<p class="pjust">
				In this section, we visualize the examine the data collected over several peak periods in a calendar week. We assume that that the distibution of peak periods doesnt differ between different days. (ie., Thursday lunch peak period and Wednesday lunch peak period are the same.)
			</p>
			<p class="pjust">
				Below, we visualize lead time, interarrival time, and queue length (# customers waiting in queue) statistics.

					<p class="pjust">In the figure on the left we observe the change of lead time over the total number of customers during various peak hour periods. Each period can be differentiated by the second series which denotes the total number of customers in each period. Lead time is defined as the duration between when the customer first joins the queue and finally collects his order. 
					</p>
					<p class="pjust">
					In each peak hour period there are between 1-3 speaks in lead time ranging between 370 to 740 seconds (ie., 6 mins 10 seconds to 12 mins 20 seconds). The 5 number summary of the queue length data is as follows: (min, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, max)=(33,185,305,379,740). It is also worth noting that standard deviation is high at 151 seconds.
					</p>
					<p class="pjust">In the figure on the right, we observe the distribution
					of all lead time observations collected. The bin with the modal lead time is [328,387].
					</p>
					<p class="pjust">
					Through this project, we aim to lower the average waiting time during peak hours through a more efficient queueuing system, which would in turn lead to a reduction in lead time for customers to collect their orders.
