			<h1>Project Description</h1>

			<div class = "text">
				<p>
				Queues are a common phenomenon that arise due the fact that resources are limited,
				and time is required in order to provide some sort of service to make a good available.
				When this duration of time which shall be denoted as service time becomes too large,
				customers that are paying to obtain that good or service become dissatisfied as opportunity
				cost for utilizing that time in better ways becomes increasingly larger. Designing queueing systems involves obtaining a balance between service time to prepare the good
				from a pool of limited resources and the waiting time customers experience.
				</p> 
				<p>Food and beverage outlets in the price-competitive landscape of hawker centres and food courts typically experience similar intra-day customer demand distributions, with peaks during breakfast, lunch and dinner timings. Efficient queueing systems allow these enterprises to meet customer	demand during these peak periods by increasing through-put rates. </p>
				<p>In this project, we aim to model and simulate the queueing systems of one of the food stalls in the SUTD canteen during peak periods. After analysing the distributions of customer arrivals, departures, and service times, we aim to simulate the flow of customers through the current queuing system and that of a proposed alternative queueing model. By simulating the original customer arrival rate with the new model, we will determine if the alternative queueing model will help customers to spend less time in the system (lower lead time).	</p>

					<p>
					<b>Key questions that our project aims to answer:</b> <br />
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
						<li>Is the time customers spend (lead time) of the alternative queueuing model statistically more significant than that of the currently utilized queueing system? </li>
						<li>How does the number of customers at the start (initialization) affect the lead time?</li>
					</ul>
