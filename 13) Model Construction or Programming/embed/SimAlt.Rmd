title: "Alternative Queue"
output: html_notebook
---
This is the function used to generate one instance of the Alternative queue. 
It uses the common functions to generate a random string of numbers as well as the exponential rv for interarrivals and normal rv for service time
The first part for generating interarrival times is the same as the traditional queue.
But the latter part on processing customers is different
```{r}
#Here we generate the data for the traditional queue

### Set Parameters ##########################
## parameters system
arrival0 = 56    #mean arrival times of customers (non-peak)
arrival1 = 43     #mean arrival times of customers (peak)
foodmean = 20     #mean service times of counter
normvar = 10
normmin = 10

service_ordertime = 20      #Time taken to order/pay for food (fixed at 20s)
