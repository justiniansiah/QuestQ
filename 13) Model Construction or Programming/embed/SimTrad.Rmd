title: "Traditional Queue"
output: html_notebook
---
This is the function used to generate one instance of the traditional queue. 
It uses the common functions to generate a random string of numbers as well as the exponential rv for interarrivals and normal rv for service time
```{r}
#Here we generate the data for the traditional queue

### Set Parameters ##########################
## parameters system
arrival0 = 56    #mean arrival times of customers (non-peak)
arrival1 = 43     #mean arrival times of customers (peak)
tradmean = 48     #mean service times of counter
normvar = 10
normmin = 10


## Simulate 1 run of Traditional Queue
